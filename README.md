## 🎯 Features

- **Graph Implementation:** Uses an adjacency list to represent the metro network  
- **Shortest Path Algorithms:** Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path  
- **BFS and DFS:** Supports breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) for pathfinding  
- **Input Validation:** Ensures valid station names and travel times  
- **User Interaction:** User-friendly interface for entering source and destination stations
